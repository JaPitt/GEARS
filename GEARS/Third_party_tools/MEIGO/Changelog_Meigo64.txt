MEIGO64 - last revised 18 January 2018. 

--> Update 16-May-2017 (AFV):

- Modified 'ess_kernel.m' so that it stores all the intermediate points in the optimizations,
even when no local search is used. 

--> Update 02-May-2017 (AFV):

- CeSS now accepts different local methods for different threads.
- Multistart can be performed with several local methods.
- Changes in the way CeSS is invoked: it is now called similarly as other methods, i.e.: 
>> MEIGO(problem,opts,'cess')


--> Update 19-April-2017 (AFV):

- eSS made robust with respect to possible crashes in local searches:
Modified "ess_local_filters" including a try-catch in the call to "ssm_localsolver".


--> (JRB/JEGEA) Update 11-November-2016: 

- corrected printing of objf when all points are infeasible 
- added printing fobj for x0 if x0 is supplied

--> (ALEX) Update 7-November-2016: 

- Provide high quality gradients to FMINCON, calculated with AMICI using adjoint sensitivities
(initially implemented by Daniel Weindl, September 2016).

--> Update 20-May-2016

- the parallel solver CeSS and CeVNS now use the Matlab Parallel Computing toolbox instead of jPar.
(the use of jPar seems to be problematic in the latest Matlab versions due to changes in the JRE). 
Before using CeSS or CeVNS, launch the workers using e.g. matlabpool open local 4 for 4 threads
This is a contribution by Lukas Widmer (ETHZ).

--> Update 20-May-2016

Example:
- in the Goodwin updated example, sensisitivities are now computed with AMICI 
 (software from Hasenauer group)

-->Previous (9-May-2016):

What is new in MEIGO64:
- new MEIGO version for Matlab 64 bit (mex64 for most local solvers, including Win and Linux)
- includes updated mex solvers: nl2sol (for parameter estmation), misqp (for MINLP), etc.
- nl2sol accepts high-quality gradients computed by sensitivities (see Gábor and Banga, 2015)

Example:
- the Goodwin_example folder illustrates these capabilities with an oscillator model. Sensitivities
  are computed with odeSD (from J. Stelling group at ETHZ), but other sensitivities solvers can be used
- this example is the same used in Gábor and Banga (2015), although no regularization here
